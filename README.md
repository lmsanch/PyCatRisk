# PyCatRisk
IPython Notebook to collect earthquake data from the USGS, around a specific geographical location, and design an insurance linked security (ILS) to launch to the capitla markets. Pandas for time series analysis of earthquake historical data. Monte Carlo Error Propagation to generate simulated earthquakes and calculate exceedance loss probabilities on life on ILS. Scikit-learn, and/or other original algorithms to select best parameters to fit target credit rating, ILS parameters, and predict spread over LIBOR of the security. http://bit.ly/1IgIA8N
